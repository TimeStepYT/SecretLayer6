# SecretLayer6
This mod gives you access to the <cr>unused</c> SecretLayer6, which is just a remake of <cb>Memory Mastermind</c>, an older game by <co>RobTop</c>.

Note that the minigame is <cr>slightly broken</c> in the way that when you finish the last level, it goes back to an easier one and stays on it.

Just as a reference, <cy>SecretLayer5 is the Wraith</c>. Put the code <cy>"Mastermind"</c> in <cp>the Wraith</c> to unlock the button!
